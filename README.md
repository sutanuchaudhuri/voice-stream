```

### File Status Tracking

The export system intelligently handles missing audio files:

- **`found`**: Audio file successfully located and included in export
- **`missing`**: Audio file referenced in database but not found on filesystem

#### Missing File Scenarios

Audio files may be missing due to:
- Manual file deletion from filesystem
- Storage migration or cleanup
- Corrupted file systems
- Network storage disconnection

**Important**: Even if audio files are missing, their annotation data and transcriptions are preserved and included in the CSV export.

### Export Processing Details

#### Audio File Resolution Process

1. **Storage Manager Lookup**: First attempts to load via configured storage system (local/S3)
2. **Local Filesystem Fallback**: Searches local project directories if storage manager fails
3. **Path Resolution**: Handles both absolute and relative file paths
4. **Status Logging**: Detailed logging of found vs missing files

#### Export Statistics

Each export includes a summary in the README.txt file:

```
Audio Annotation Export - project_name

- Use timestamps to track data freshness
- Store exports in version control or backup systems

#### For Quality Assurance
- Review `original_transcript` vs `transcription` for editing patterns
- Monitor `file_status` for data integrity issues
- Track annotation creation patterns over time
- Identify frequently edited transcriptions for quality improvement

### Troubleshooting Export Issues

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Empty ZIP File**: 
   - Check if project has annotations
   - Verify project ID is correct
   - Ensure database connectivity

2. **Missing Audio Files**:
   - Check file system permissions
   - Verify storage configuration
   - Review file paths in database
